# Binary Distillation

Interactive Jupyter Notebook to Design a Column for Binary Distillation. 
A graphical design procedure called as MacCabe-Thiele method is used for designing the distillation coulmn.

## Content

MacCabe-Thiele folder consists of two notebooks,

    1. Saturated Feed - It only designs distillation column for saturated liquid feed and saturated vapour feed.
    2. General Feed - It designs distillation column for any general case of the binary distillation.
